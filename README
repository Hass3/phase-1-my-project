Welcome to My Superior Auction Website

This web application allows the user to search for any of the cars listed on the top of the page. 
This web apliaction uses three event listeners DOMContentLoaded, Submit, and click.
once the user searches for the specific car a car card with the information and 
two buttons at the button of the card show up. The first button "Show Description"
when clicked shows the cars description and the second is a delete button which deletes the
car card from the DOM.
Also under the text box I added a little filter button. This button when clicked creates 
a small div on the right side of the page which shows a list of all the cars that are under 
90,000 dollars.
